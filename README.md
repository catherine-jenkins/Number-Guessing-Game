# Number-Guessing-Game (Java)

This is a Java program that runs a game for the user. In this game, a secret number between 1 and 100 is randomly chosen, and the user must input guesses until the correct number is found. If the user's guess is too high, the computer will print "Too High". Similarly, if the guess is too low, the computer will print "Too Low". Once the user guesses the correct number, the computer will print a congratulatory message, along with the number of guesses the user made. The program runs as follows: 

Step 1: Prompt the user to guess a number between 1 and 100.


Step 2: Get the user's guess.


Step 3: Find a random number to be the secret number.


Step 4: If the user's guess is correct, print the congratulatory message.


Step 5: If the user's guess is incorrect, determine whether the user's guess is too high or too low and print the correct corresponding message. Repeat this until the user's guess is correct.


Step 6: Each time the user makes a guess that is not correct, add 1 to the number of guesses.
